These days there are a lot of valuable information on the Web. Lots of courses, videos, articles and tutorials produce a mess of unsorted information. Lets imagine that one day you want to start learning something new on the web.

A typical scenario would be like:

Google -> **Read** -> Google -> **Watch** -> Google -> **Close** -> Google -> **Add to bookmark** -> Google .. Google .. Google

Googling is nice but... Think about how many people will walk the same road? What if they could share learning roadmaps with others?
